# Heartcheck

Heartcheck is a monitoring tool for Rack applications. It provides a DSL to
declare service checks and an URI that returns the status for each service.
With this gem you can monitor if your app has access to the database, a cache
service, an API, etc.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'heartcheck'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install heartcheck

## Usage

First generate the config file for the framework you are using:

    $ heartcheck rails
    $ heartcheck padrino
    $ heartcheck sinatra

Then edit the generated file by adding your checks on it and restart your
server. Now you should be able to make a HTTP request for `/monitoring` and
get a JSON response that contains the status for each monitored service.

The following environment variables are needed by heartcheck:

    HEARTCHECK_APP_NAME=MyApplicationName


### Using built-in checks

#### Firewall check

```ruby
Heartcheck.setup do |config|
  config.add :firewall do |c|
    c.add_service(host: 'domain.com', port: 80)
    c.add_service(host: 'domain.com', port: 80, timeout: 5) # Default timeout is 2 seconds
    c.add_service(url: 'https://domain.com')
    c.add_service(url: 'https://domain.com', proxy: 'http://proxy.domain.com')
  end
end
```

## HTTP Routes

#### Basic health check

To get the status for all services, make a HTTP request for the following URI:

    /monitoring

It will return a JSON response and a status for each service.

#### Functional status

Functional services are services essential for your application. You can get
their status using the following route:

    /monitoring/functional

#### Info route

This route returns custom information about your app. You can configure it to
return whatever information you want:

    /monitoring/info

#### Dev status

Returns some debugging information:

    /monitoring/dev

#### Very basic health check

Returns a simple `ok` if the app is running. It does not execute any configured
checks:

    /monitoring/health_check


#### General info and dependencies

Returns general application info and a list of dependencies' URIs, but executes no checking:

    /monitoring/inspect

## Response formatting

An optional formatter may be set for the monitoring response. We provide the default format
using a list of hashes and one with a single Hash. Please check `Heartcheck.use_hash_formatter!`

#### Docker

Heartcheck can be setup with Docker and Docker Compose on macOS or Linux systems,
so that you don't need to install ruby and it's dependencies via rbenv or rvm.

Just do your setup locally by running:

```
./scripts/heartcheck setup
```

Run `./scripts/heartcheck -h` to see available options, such as bash, rspec, etc.
